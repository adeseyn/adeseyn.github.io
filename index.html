<h1> Github Tutorial </h1>
<p> Hello, my name is Austin. I was born in Newark, NY and moved to Elmira, NY when I was 10 years old. I went to Elmira High School and was a member of the VEX robotics team. Some of my hobbies include hanging out with friends, playing video games, and taking naps. I knew I wanted to go to RIT since freshman year of high school and it was the only college I applied to.<\p>
